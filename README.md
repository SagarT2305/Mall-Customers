# Mall-Customers

Problem Statement: For the given Unsupervised problem set, form clusters for the set/group of customers on the basis of following factors.
                     
                     1. Age
                     2. Annual Income (k$)

1. Remove columns with unique values.
2. Data Visualization.
3. Used Elbow curve method to find out the specified value of number of clusters (k).
4. Form clusters by grouping the customers on the basis of factors mentioned above.
